# Multiple Shader Output Experiemtnation

This project aims to determine whether it's possible to return multiple values from a single shader. Ideally, we'd like to use a single shader 
to output a vertex's world position and normal.

# Brief Results

Unity does have a way to return multiple outputs (up to four), however it seems that it's only supported for color.
