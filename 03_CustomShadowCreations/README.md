# Custom Shadow Creations

An attempt to recreate our own shader maps in hope to do something similar for caustics. A method that follows closely to the "ShadowCaster" project is used as well as a fullyh custom implementation as well.

# Brief Results

Was able to get some decent results with the custom implementation, however, the shadows appear elongated from the object.
